* What

	This container provides a web frontend for browsing git repositories, powered by cgit.

* Implementation

	cgit is a cgi script, hence we require a web server to parse the HTTP request and pass it on to cgit.

	nginx is chosen as the web server of choice, however note that nginx cannot use cgi scripts, and instead must use "fast-cgi" (IE: a long running process that requests are sent to).

	Hence we use "fcgiwrap" which is a small utility program which presents a fastcgi interface but really calls a cgi script per request.

	Hence the data flow is:

	=client ---[tcp socket]---> nginx ---[unix socket]---> fcgiwrap ---[run program]---> cgit=

	Note also that the fcgiwrap process is managed by =spawn-fcgi=, which performs additional management such as setting the socket permissions
