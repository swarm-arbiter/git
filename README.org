* What

	This container provides a web frontend for browsing git repositories, powered by cgit.

* Implementation

	cgit is a cgi script, hence we require a web server to parse the HTTP request and pass it on to cgit.

	We use "lighttpd" which has native support for cgi scripts.

	Hence the data flow for a request is:
	=client ---[tcp socket]---> lighttpd ---[execute cgi script]---> cgit.cgi=
